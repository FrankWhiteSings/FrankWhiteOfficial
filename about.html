<h2>About Frank White</h2>
  <p>
    Frank White is not just a singer — he is a feeling.

Born in The Bronx, shaped by grit, rhythm, and raw truth, Frank carries a voice that doesn’t simply perform melodies — it testifies. Every note he sings holds lived experience: love gained, love lost, sacrifices made, and dreams refused to die.

An October-born Libra, Frank embodies balance — strength and softness, pain and hope, struggle and faith. That balance shows up in his music: emotionally grounded, soul-driven, and unmistakably honest. His voice reaches people not because it tries to impress, but because it tells the truth.

Now residing in Philadelphia, Frank continues his journey as an independent artist and a single father, raising his son Amir while chasing a calling bigger than himself. Fatherhood didn’t slow the dream — it deepened it. Amir is his “why,” his fuel, and his reminder that purpose is worth pursuing even when the road is long.

Frank believes no dream is achieved alone. With Amir and his village — family, friends, and believers — what once felt impossible is now becoming inevitable. Every rehearsal, every performance, every quiet moment of doubt turned into determination is part of a larger promise: to show his son what it looks like to never give up.

Musically, Frank’s sound is rooted in soul, R&B, and emotional storytelling. His performances are intimate yet powerful — the kind that make audiences pause, reflect, cry, and heal. He doesn’t sing at people; he sings with them.

Frank’s ultimate goal is not fame — it is impact. He is on a mission to spread love through music and to bring that love to global stages such as America’s Got Talent, The Voice, and American Idol — platforms where authenticity still matters and stories still change lives.

Frank White is proof that dreams don’t expire, purpose doesn’t fade, and love — when carried through music — can reach farther than fear ever could.

This is not the end of his story.
It’s the moment it finally gets heard.
